🏠 System Overview

Primary control: Each Ecobee (one per zone) decides what to call for (Heat / Cool / Fan / Dehumidify).

BMPLUS-3000 zone panel: Acts as a traffic director — routes those calls to the equipment and positions dampers.

Equipment: Rheem RP14 single-stage heat pump with single-stage propane furnace (aux heat).

Dampers: Each zone’s M1 = common, M4 = close, M6 = open.

Dehumidifier: GeneralAire unit triggered only by Zone 2 (basement) Ecobee’s humidity call through a relay.

🔥 1. Heating – Heat Pump Mode

Trigger: Either Ecobee calls for heat when outdoor conditions are above your Ecobee’s balance-point temperature.
Signals: Ecobee → Y1 (compressor), O (reversing valve = heat), G (fan).

Sequence

Ecobee issues heat call.

BMPLUS-3000:

Opens the calling zone’s damper(s).

Closes all other dampers.

Sends Y1 + O + G to the heat pump / air handler.

Heat pump energizes in heating mode.

Blower starts immediately (some units have a 5–10 s delay).

When the thermostat is satisfied:

Ecobee drops Y1; BMPLUS stops the call; blower runs ~90 s post-purge.

Dampers return to neutral / standby.

Normal Delays & Protections

Compressor short-cycle delay: 5 min built-in at the heat pump and sometimes in Ecobee.

Zone panel call overlap delay: ~30 s stagger to prevent simultaneous zone calls.

Fan off-delay: 60–90 s to clear coil heat.

🔥 2. Auxiliary Heat – Propane Furnace (Dual Fuel)

Trigger:

Ecobee decides outdoor temperature is below your Compressor Lockout or Aux Lock-in setpoint.

Or the heat pump ran too long without reaching setpoint.

Signals: Ecobee → W1 (heat call) only — no Y1/O.

Sequence

Ecobee disables the compressor and energizes W1.

BMPLUS-3000 forwards W1 to the furnace control board.

Furnace:

Begins its ignition sequence (~30 s pre-purge, ignition, flame establish).

Controls its own blower delay (typically 30–45 s after burner ignition).

When satisfied:

Ecobee drops W1.

Furnace shuts gas, runs post-purge fan (60–90 s).

BMPLUS opens/closes dampers back to normal.

Normal Delays & Protections

Compressor lockout: Ensures no simultaneous HP + furnace run.

Furnace time-based fan control: The BMPLUS lets the furnace handle blower timing.

Short-cycle prevention: Ecobee minimum on/off times (default 5 min).

❄️ 3. Cooling – Heat Pump Mode

Trigger: Either Ecobee calls for cooling (indoor temp > setpoint).
Signals: Ecobee → Y1 (compressor), O (reversing valve = cool), G (fan).

Sequence

Ecobee calls for cooling.

BMPLUS opens the calling zone’s damper(s), closes others.

Sends Y1 + O + G to the outdoor unit.

Heat pump runs in cooling mode.

Blower runs immediately.

When satisfied:

Ecobee drops Y1; BMPLUS releases the call.

Blower continues 60–90 s post-cool-off.

Dampers normalize.

Normal Delays & Protections

Compressor anti-short-cycle: 5 min typical.

Condensate / coil defrost safety: BMPLUS ignores brief drops in thermostat signal.

Zone coordination delay: ~30 s between zone calls.

💧 4. Dehumidify – Basement Zone Only

Trigger: Zone 2 Ecobee detects humidity above setpoint (e.g., > 50%).
Signals: Ecobee ACC+ → relay coil → GeneralAire D1–D2 closed.

Sequence

Ecobee sends 24 VAC on ACC+.

Relay (RIBU1C) energizes:

Closes D1–D2 on GeneralAire → dehumidifier runs.

Forces Zone 2 damper OPEN (M1→M6).

Forces Zone 1 damper CLOSED (M1→M4).

BMPLUS fan output energizes blower at low speed (G signal).

Dehumidifier pulls air from the return; exhausts dry air back into the same plenum.

When humidity is satisfied:

Ecobee drops ACC+; relay de-energizes; D1–D2 open → dehumidifier stops.

Dampers revert to normal zone control.

Blower runs its fan-off delay (30–60 s).

Normal Delays & Protections

Hysteresis: Ecobee waits ~2 % RH below setpoint before dropping call (prevents short cycling).

Fan During Dehumidify: Set to OFF so blower runs only when the relay is active.

Lockout: Dehumidifier will not run during compressor defrost or aux-heat mode.

Minimum off-time: Usually 3 min internal to GeneralAire.

⚙️ 5. Common Timing Summary
Function	Typical Delay / Protection	Who Controls It
Compressor restart	5 min	Heat pump & Ecobee
Furnace pre-purge	30 s	Furnace
Furnace blower start	30–45 s	Furnace
Blower off delay	60–90 s	Furnace or BMPLUS
Zone call spacing	30 s stagger	BMPLUS
Dehumidifier hysteresis	~2 % RH	Ecobee
Dehumidifier min-off	3 min	GeneralAire
🔄 6. What You’ll Hear / See in Operation
Situation	What You’ll Notice
Normal heat pump heat	Outdoor unit running, indoor blower on low speed; only one zone blowing air.
Aux heat (propane)	Outdoor unit silent, furnace firing after short delay; stronger airflow and warmer discharge.
Cooling	Outdoor unit running, cooler supply air; non-calling zone dampers closed (quiet).
Dehumidify	No outdoor unit; basement zone airflow only; subtle relay click near panel; GeneralAire hums.
Mode changes / power flicker	Ecobees may display “Calibrating” for ~1 min if panel browns out. Installing a small UPS + dedicated transformer eliminates this.
✅ Key Takeaways

BMPLUS-3000 adds 30 s dampers-stagger and fan control, but Ecobee handles mode logic, lockouts, and delays.

Only one zone damper opens at a time to protect airflow.

Post-run fan periods are normal and help temperature balance.

Dehumidify mode isolates Zone 2 — air movement limited to basement zone.

Expect quiet pauses between stage transitions; the system is protecting itself.
